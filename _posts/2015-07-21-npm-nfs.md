title: How to install nvm for all users on NFS
---

The environment is `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`


# NFS Server-side setup

Let's say your NFS shared directory is `/shared/local`, and it maps to local(NFS server) directory `/usr/local`

First, we need to clone nvm, `git clone https://github.com:creationix/nvm.git /usr/local/src/nvm`

Then let's make two directories for storing nvm stff.

`mkdir /usr/local/nvm`

`mkdir /usr/local/node`

And we then create `/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh` on local(NFS server), this allows us to install node binaries.

```
#!/bin/bash
export NVM_DIR=/usr/local/nvm
. /usr/local/src/nvm/nvm.sh
export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/usr/local/node
export PATH="/usr/local/node/bin:$PATH"
```

After logging out, and log back in (or simply type `. /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh`)

we then run `nvm install 0.12` (in this case, we install node v0.12, we can also install other versions)

Now run `chown 755 -R /usr/local/nvm`, this gives nfs client approriate access rights. (Otherwise you will see `Now using node undefined` after running `nvm use 0.12`)

we then create another file (maps to shared directory.Remember,client do not have nvm installed on their  `/usr/local`)

Let's make one file `/usr/local/nvm.sh` on nfs server

```
#!/bin/bash
export NVM_DIR=/shared/local/nvm
. /shared/local/src/nvm/nvm.sh
export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/shared/local/node
xport PATH="/shared/local/node/bin:$PATH"
```



#2 NFS Client-side setup

Now, let's log into client server (as root)

Let's create one file `/etc/profile.d/shared.sh`

```
#!/bin/bash
export PATH="/shared/local/bin:$PATH"
. /shared/local/init.sh
```

This will execute nvm initation scripts we created at the end of last section and add node binaries locations to `PATH`

Now you can log out and log back in, type `nvm` , TADA!!
